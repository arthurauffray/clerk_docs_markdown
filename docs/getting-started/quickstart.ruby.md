# Ruby Quickstart


> Learn how to use Clerk to quickly and easily add secure authentication and user management to your Ruby application.

Learn how to use Clerk to quickly and easily add secure authentication and user management to your Ruby app. If you would like to use a framework, see the [reference docs](/reference/ruby/overview).


  ## Create a new Ruby app

  If you don't already have a Ruby app, run the following commands to [create a new one](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html).

  ```bash
  rails new clerk-ruby
  cd clerk-ruby
  ```

  ## Install `clerk-sdk-ruby`

  The [Clerk Ruby SDK](/reference/ruby/overview) provides a range of backend utilities to simplify user authentication and management in your application.

1. Add the following code to your application's `Gemfile`.
   ```ruby
# Filename: Gemfile

   gem 'clerk-sdk-ruby', require: "clerk"
   ```
1. Run the following command to install the SDK:
   ```sh
# Filename: terminal

   bundle install
   ```


  ## Configuration

  The configuration object provides a flexible way to configure the SDK. When a configuration value is not explicitly provided, it will fall back to checking the corresponding [environment variable](/reference/ruby/overview#available-environment-variables). You must provide your Clerk Secret Key.

The following example shows how to set up your configuration object:

```ruby
Clerk.configure do |c|
  c.secret_key = `{{secret}}` # if omitted: ENV["CLERK_SECRET_KEY"] - API calls will fail if unset
  c.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT) # if omitted, no logging
end
```

For more information, see [Faraday's documentation](https://lostisland.github.io/faraday/#/).


  ## Instantiate a `Clerk::SDK` instance

  All available methods are listed in the [Ruby SDK documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-ruby?tab=readme-ov-file#available-resources-and-operations), which provides a more Ruby-friendly interface.

  To access available methods, you must instantiate a `Clerk::SDK` instance.

  ```ruby
  sdk = Clerk::SDK.new
  req = Clerk::Models::Operations::CreateUserRequest.new(
    first_name: "John",
    last_name: "Doe",
    email_address: ["john.doe@example.com"],
    password: "password"
  )

  # Create a user
  sdk.users.create(request: create_user_request)

  # List all users and ensure the user was created
  sdk.users.list(request: Clerk::Models::Operations::GetUserListRequest.new())

  # Get the first user created in your instance
  user = sdk.users.list(request: Clerk::Models::Operations::GetUserListRequest.new(limit: 1)).first

  # Use the user's ID to lock the user
  sdk.users.lock_user(user_id: user.id)

  # Then, unlock the user so they can sign in again
  sdk.users.unlock_user(user_id: user.id)
  ```

  ## Run your project

  Run your project with the following command:

  ```bash
  rails server
  ```
