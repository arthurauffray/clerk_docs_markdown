# Add Facebook as a social connection


> Learn how to allow users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk app with their Facebook account using OAuth.

Enabling OAuth with Facebook allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk app with their Facebook account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs—no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
1. Select **Facebook** from the provider list.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Facebook Developer](https://developers.facebook.com) page.


  ### Enable Facebook as a social connection

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. Select **Facebook** from the provider list.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Redirect URI** somewhere secure. Keep this page open.

  ### Create a Facebook app

  1. In the top-right of the Facebook Developer page, select [**My Apps**](https://developers.facebook.com/apps).
  1. In the top-right, select **Create App**. You'll be redirected to the **Create an app** process.
     1. In the **App details** step, fill out the necessary information and select **Next**.
     1. In the **Use Cases** step, select **Authenticate and request data from users with Facebook Login** and then select **Next**.
     1. In the **Business** step, select the business portfolio to connect to your app and then select **Next**.
     1. In the **Finalize** step, select **Go to dashboard**. You'll be redirected to the app's **Dashboard** page.
  1. In the left sidenav, select **Use cases**.
  1. Next to **Authenticate and request data from users with Facebook Login**, select **Customize**. You'll be redirected to the **Permissions** tab of the **Customize use case** page.
  1. Next to **email**, select **Add**. This permission allows Clerk to read your user's primary email address.
  1. In the left sidenav, under **Facebook Login**, select **Settings**.
  1. In the **Client OAuth settings** section, in the **Valid OAuth Redirect URIs** field, paste the **Redirect URI** value you saved from the Clerk Dashboard.
  1. Select **Save changes**.
  1. In the left sidenav, select **App settings** (hover over the settings icon to view the title or expand the menu), and then select **Basic**.
  1. Save the **App ID** and **App Secret** somewhere secure.

  ### Set the App ID and App Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

  1. Navigate back to the Clerk Dashboard where the configuration page should still be open. Paste the **App ID** and **App Secret** values that you saved into the respective fields.
  1. Select **Save**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the page is no longer open, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page in the Clerk Dashboard. Select the connection. Under **Use custom credentials**, you can paste the values into their respective fields.

  ### Test your connection

  The simplest way to test your connection is to visit your Clerk app's [Account Portal](/guides/account-portal/overview), which is available for all Clerk apps out-of-the-box.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/account-portal) page.
1. Next to **Sign-in**, select the button to visit the sign-in page. The URL should resemble:
   - **For development** - `https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in`
   - **For production** - `https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in`
1. Sign in with your connection's credentials.
