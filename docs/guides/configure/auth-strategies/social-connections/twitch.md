# Add Twitch as a social connection


> Learn how to allow users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk app with their Twitch account with OAuth.

Enabling OAuth with [Twitch](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference#oauth-client-credentials-flow) allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk application with their Twitch account.

You must have Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) enabled on your Twitch account to setup OAuth. To enable 2FA:

1. In the top-right of the [Twitch Developer console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console), select your avatar and select **Account Settings**.
1. Select the **Security & Privacy** tab.
1. Under **Security**, select **Set Up Two-Factor Authentication**.
1. Select **Enable 2FA**. A modal will open.
1. Enter your phone number and select **Continue**.
1. Enter the code sent to your phone and select **Continue**.
1. If you want to use an authenticator app, follow the instructions on the screen. Otherwise, select **Skip & Use SMS**.
1. Select **Done**.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs—no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
1. Select **Twitch** from the provider list.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console).

  ### Create a Twitch Developer app

  1. In the left sidenav of the [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console), select **Applications**.
  1. Select **Register Your Application**. You'll be redirected to the [**Register Your Application**](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps/create) page.
  1. Complete the required fields. Under **OAuth Redirect URLs**, paste the **OAuth Redirect URL** you saved from the Clerk Dashboard.
  1. Select **Create**. You'll be redirected to the **Developer Applications** page where you can see your new application listed.

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

  1. Navigate back to the Clerk Dashboard where the configuration page should still be open. Paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** values that you saved into the respective fields.
1. Select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> If the page is no longer open, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page in the Clerk Dashboard. Select the connection. Under **Use custom credentials**, paste the values into their respective fields.


  ### Test your connection

  The simplest way to test your connection is to visit your Clerk app's [Account Portal](/guides/account-portal/overview), which is available for all Clerk apps out-of-the-box.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/account-portal) page.
1. Next to **Sign-in**, select the button to visit the sign-in page. The URL should resemble:
   - **For development** - `https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in`
   - **For production** - `https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in`
1. Sign in with your connection's credentials.
