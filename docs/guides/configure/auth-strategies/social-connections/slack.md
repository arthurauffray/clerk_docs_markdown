# Add Slack as a social connection


> Learn how to allow users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk app with their Slack account using OAuth.

Enabling OAuth with [Slack](https://api.slack.com/authentication) allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk app with their Slack account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs—no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
1. Select **Slack** from the provider list.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Slack's API Platform](https://api.slack.com/).


  ### Enable Slack as a social connection in Clerk

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. Select **Slack** from the provider list.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Redirect URL** somewhere secure. Keep this page open.

  ### Create a Slack app

  1. In the Slack API Platform, navigate to the [**Your Apps**](https://api.slack.com/apps) page and select **Create New App**.
  1. The **Create an app** modal will open. Depending on your app needs, select either **From a manifest** or **From scratch**. For more information on which to choose, refer to [Slack's doc on manifests](https://api.slack.com/reference/manifests).
  1. After following the respective steps for either option, you'll be redirected to the **App Credentials** page. Save the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** somewhere secure. Keep this page open.
  1. In the sidenav, navigate to the **OAuth & Permissions** page.
  1. Scroll down to the **Redirect URLs** section and select **Add New Redirect URL**. Paste the **Redirect URL** you saved from the Clerk Dashboard. Select **Add**, then select **Save URLs**.

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

  1. Navigate back to the Clerk Dashboard where the configuration page should still be open. Paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** values that you saved into the respective fields.
1. Select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> If the page is no longer open, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page in the Clerk Dashboard. Select the connection. Under **Use custom credentials**, paste the values into their respective fields.


  ### Test your connection

  The simplest way to test your connection is to visit your Clerk app's [Account Portal](/guides/account-portal/overview), which is available for all Clerk apps out-of-the-box.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/account-portal) page.
1. Next to **Sign-in**, select the button to visit the sign-in page. The URL should resemble:
   - **For development** - `https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in`
   - **For production** - `https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in`
1. Sign in with your connection's credentials.
