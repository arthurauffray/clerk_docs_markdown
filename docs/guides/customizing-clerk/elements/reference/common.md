# Common components


> Reference documentation for common Clerk Elements components.

> [!WARNING]
> Clerk Elements is no longer in development and will not receive any updates. We're actively building a replacement for Clerk Elements with a different approach to customization, and we'll share more details soon.


Clerk Elements provides a set of common components that are used across all flows. It's recommended to import them all under the `Clerk` namespace to make discovery easier and reduce naming conflicts with other common components throughout your application. The code snippets on this page assume you have imported the components this way.

```tsx
// Filename: Anatomy

import * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'
```

Unless otherwise mentioned, all components accept a `className` prop.

## ``

Renders a social connection button based on the provided `name`. Throws an error in development if the provided social connection is not enabled in your instance. See [Social connections (OAuth)](/guides/configure/auth-strategies/social-connections/overview) to learn how to enable them in the Clerk Dashboard.

By default, `` will be rendered as an unstyled `<button>`.

### Properties {{ toc: false }}

- **`asChild`** `boolean` (optional)

  If `true`, `` will render as its child element, passing along any necessary props. Default: `false`

    ---

- **`name`** `string`

  Name of the social connection to render.


### Usage {{ toc: false }}

```tsx
// Filename: page.tsx


  
    Sign in with Google</Clerk.Connection>
  </SignIn.Step>
</SignIn.Root>
```

You can enrich this example by providing an [``](#icon) to display the social connection's logo.

## ``

Associates its child elements with a specific ``. It automatically generates unique IDs and associates child `` and `` elements with each other.

### Properties {{ toc: false }}

- **`name`** `'code' | 'confirmPassword' | 'currentPassword' | 'emailAddress' | 'firstName' | 'identifier' | 'lastName' | 'name' | 'newPassword' | 'password' | 'phoneNumber' | 'username'`

  Name for form field, will be used to associate all underlying field elements.

    ---

- **`alwaysShow?`** `boolean`

  When `true`, the field will always be rendered, regardless of its state. When `false`, the field is hidden if it's optional or if it's a filled-out required field. Default: `false`

    ---

- **`children?`** `(state: 'success' | 'error' | 'warning' | 'info' | 'idle') => React.ReactNode`

  Provide a function as children and access the field's state.


### Usage {{ toc: false }}

Place common components like [``](#input), [``](#field-error), or [``](#label) inside ``.

```tsx
</Clerk.Field>
```

#### Function as children

The `state` you can access here is the same as in [``](#field-state).

```tsx
{(state) => <p>Field's state is: {state}</p>}</Clerk.Field>
```

## ``

Renders error messages associated with a specific ``. By default, the error's message will be rendered in an unstyled `<span>`. Optionally, the `children` prop accepts a function to customize rendering.

### Properties {{ toc: false }}

- **`name?`** `string`

  Used to target a specific field by name when rendering outside of a `` component. Default: Automatically inferred

    ---

- **`asChild?`** `boolean`

  If `true`, `` will render as its child element, passing along any necessary props. Default: `false`

    ---

- **`children?`** `({ message: string, code: string }) => React.ReactNode`

  Provide a function as children and access the error's `message` and `code`.


### Usage {{ toc: false }}

If the `` is in an error state, `` will display its message.

```tsx

  
</Clerk.Field>
```

#### Function as children

By having access to both `message` and `code` you can enrich the incoming `message` or localize it by checking for a specific `code`.

```tsx

  
    {({ message, code }) => (
      <span>
        {message} ({code})
      </span>
    )}
  </Clerk.FieldError>
</Clerk.Field>
```

## ``

Enables you to programmatically access additional information from the parent `` component. By default, you'll have access to `state`. `state` will also contain the field's [`ValidityState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState). `` is useful for implementing animations if you need direct access to the `state` value.

If you use ``, additional information in the form of `message` and `codes` is provided.

### Properties {{ toc: false }}

- **`children`** `(args: { state: 'success' | 'error' | 'warning' | 'info' | 'idle'; message: string | undefined; codes: (string | [string, Record<string, string | number>])[] | undefined }) => React.ReactNode`

  Use this function to access the field's state. Optionally, information regarding password validation is given.


### Usage {{ toc: false }}

`` will start with a `state` of `idle` until the user interacts with it. Depending on the user's input, the `state` will change to `success` or `error`.

```tsx


  Email</Clerk.Label>
  
  {({ state }) => <p>Field's state is: {state}</p>}</Clerk.FieldState>
</Clerk.Field>
```

#### ``

If you're using [``](#input-type-password), the ``'s children function receives additional arguments:

- **`message`** `string`

  The standardized English message generated for the current state of the input. This message is generated based on the codes associated with the ``.

    ---

- **`codes`** `(string | [string, Record<string, string | number>])[]`

  The error codes associated with the ``. You can use these codes to return a custom `message` or localize its contents.


Initially, the `` will have a `state` of `idle` until the user interacts with the input. Depending on the user's input, the `state` will change to `'success' | 'error' | 'warning' | 'info'`.

```tsx


  Password</Clerk.Label>
  
  
    {({ state, codes, message }) => (
      <div>
        <pre>Field state: {state}</pre>
        <pre>Field msg: {message}</pre>
        <pre>Codes: {JSON.stringify(codes, null, 2)}</pre>
      </div>
    )}
  </Clerk.FieldState>
</Clerk.Field>
```

## ``

Renders errors that are returned from Clerk's API but are not associated with a specific form field. By default, renders the error's message wrapped in a `<div>`. Optionally, the `children` prop accepts a function to customize rendering. **Must be a child of components like ``/`` to have access to the underlying form state**.

### Properties {{ toc: false }}

- **`asChild?`** `boolean`

  If `true`, `` will render as its child element, passing along any necessary props. Default: `false`

    ---

- **`code?`** `string`

  Forces the message with the matching code to be shown. This is useful when using server-side validation. Default: `undefined`

    ---

- **`children?`** `({ message: string, code: string }) => React.ReactNode`

  Provide a function as children and access the error's `message` and `code`.


### Usage {{ toc: false }}

```tsx
// Filename: page.tsx


  
</SignIn.Root>
```

#### Function as children

By having access to both `message` and `code` you can enrich the incoming `message` or localize it by checking for specific `code`.

```tsx
// Filename: page.tsx


  
    {({ message, code }) => (
      <span>
        {message} ({code})
      </span>
    )}
  </Clerk.GlobalError>
</SignIn.Root>
```

## ``

By default, renders as an `` element with the logo of the parent `` as the value of its `src` prop. **Must be a child of [``](#connection)**.

> [!TIP]
> `` is designed to give you access to Clerk's social connection logos and has intentionally limited customizability. If you need more customizability, consider options such as [Iconify](https://iconify.design/getting-started/).

### Properties {{ toc: false }}

- **`asChild?`** `boolean`

  If `true`, `` will render as its child element, passing along any necessary props. Default: `false`


### Usage {{ toc: false }}

The following example demonstrates how to render the Google social connection logo with ``:

```tsx
// Filename: page.tsx


  
    
      
      Sign in with Google
    </Clerk.Connection>
  </SignIn.Step>
</SignIn.Root>
```

## ``

Handles rendering of [`<input />` elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) within Clerk's flows. Supports special `type` prop values to render input types that are unique to authentication and user management flows. Additional props will be passed through to the `<input />`.

> [!NOTE]
> For screen reader accessibility, always associate a [``](#label) with your `` elements.

### Properties {{ toc: false }}

- **`asChild?`** `boolean`

  If `true`, `` will render as its child element, passing along any necessary props. Default: `false`

    ---

- **`name?`** `string`

  Name for the form field. Will be used to associate all underlying field elements. Can be automatically inferred from the name on the `` component.

    ---

- **`type?`** `'text' | 'email' | 'tel' | 'otp'* | 'password'`

  Type for the input. Default: `'text'`

    ---

- **`autoComplete?`** `string`

  Refers to the [HTML attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete). If `` is used inside a `` flow and `autoComplete="webauthn"` is set, [passkey autofill](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/identity/webauthn-conditional-ui) will be attempted.


> [!NOTE]
> Values denoted with `*` are unique Clerk input types.

The following data attributes are also added to the underlying element:

- `data-valid` - If the field state is valid
- `data-invalid` - If the field state is invalid (Either the [`ValidityState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState) or has an associated error from Clerk's API)
- `date-state` - Refers to the [``](#field-state) status
- `data-has-value` - If the input has a value

### Usage {{ toc: false }}

```tsx

  Email</Clerk.Label>
  
</Clerk.Field>
```

### ``

A special type used to render an input that accepts a one-time password (OTP). If the corresponding `` has `name="code"`, the child `` will default to the `otp` type. Only numbers are accepted as inputs, and the default max length is 6.

By default, a single text `<input />` will be rendered. If provided, the `render` prop will be called for each character present in the input. This enables UI patterns where an OTP input is visually represented as N distinct elements.

#### Properties

- **`length?`** `number`

  Sets how many digits the input number can be. Default: `6`

    ---

- **`autoSubmit?`** `boolean`

  If `true`, the form will be automatically submitted once the input is filled out. Default: `false`

    ---

- **`passwordManagerOffset?`** `number`

  Password managers place their icon inside an `<input />`. This default behaviour is not desirable when you use the render prop to display N distinct element. With this prop you can increase the width of the `<input />` so that the icon is rendered outside the OTP inputs. Default: `40`

    ---

- **`render?`** `({ value, status }: { value: string; status: 'none' | 'selected' | 'cursor' | 'hovered' }) => React.ReactNode`

  A render prop function that receives the `value` and `status` of each character. `value` is the character to render, `status` is the current status of the input character.


The properties `asChild` and `name` from [``](#input) also apply to ``.

The following data attributes are also added to the underlying element:

- `data-otp-input`

#### Usage

A single `<input type="text" />` input that only allows 6 numbers to be entered. Once the user filled in all information, the form is automatically submitted.

```tsx

  
</Clerk.Field>
```

#### Segmented

You can render each number into an individual item and animate its appearance depending on the `status`.

```tsx

   <span data-status={status}>{value}</span>}
  />
</Clerk.Field>
```

### ``

A thin wrapper around the [`<input type="password" />` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/password) to provide password validation logic. You can define [password rules](/guides/secure/password-protection-and-rules) in the Clerk Dashboard. By default, this validation is turned off and you need to set a `validatePassword` prop.

Once activated, you can access the instant validation feedback through [``](#field-state) and display rich information to your users.

#### Properties

- **`validatePassword?`** `boolean`

  If `true`, password validation according to your [password rules](/guides/secure/password-protection-and-rules) is happening while the user types in their password. Default: `false`


The following data attributes are also added to the underlying Element if `validatePassword` is `true`:

- `data-has-passed-validation` - If the password has passed the validation or not

The existing data attributes from [``](#input) are also present on this Element.

#### Usage

For more information on how to use `state`, `codes`, and `message` check the [``](#field-state) docs.

```tsx


  Password</Clerk.Label>
  
  
    {({ state, codes, message }) => (
      <div>
        <pre>Field state: {state}</pre>
        <pre>Field msg: {message}</pre>
        <pre>Codes: {codes?.join(', ')}</pre>
      </div>
    )}
  </Clerk.FieldState>
</Clerk.Field>
```

## ``

Renders a `<label>` element that is automatically associated with its sibling `` inside of a ``. Additional props will be passed through to the [`<label>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label).

### Properties {{ toc: false }}

- **`asChild?`** `boolean`

  If `true`, `` will render as its child element, passing along any necessary props. Default: `false`


### Usage {{ toc: false }}

```tsx

  Label</Clerk.Label>
</Clerk.Field>
```

#### With `asChild`

```tsx

  
    <label className="my-custom-label">Label</label>
  </Clerk.Label>
</Clerk.Field>
```

## ``

Enables you to access the loading state of a chosen scope. Scope can refer to a step, a ``, or the global loading state. The global loading state is `true` when any of the other scopes are loading.

### Properties {{ toc: false }}

- **`children`** `(isLoading: boolean) => React.ReactNode`

  A function that receives `isLoading` as an argument. `isLoading` is a boolean that indicates if the current scope is loading or not.

    ---

- **`scope?`** `string`

  Specify which loading state to access. Can be a step, a connection, or the global loading state. If `` is used outside a ``, the scope will default to `'global'`. If used inside a `` the scope will default to the current step. For external authentication providers, the scope needs to be manually defined in the format of `provider:<provider name>`. Default: `'global'`


Relying on the auto-inference of the scope can be helpful when using `` in shared components, which might be referenced inside different steps. You won't need to manually pass the scope as a prop to your shared component.

### Usage {{ toc: false }}

```tsx
// Filename: page.tsx


  
    {(isGlobalLoading) => (isGlobalLoading ? 'Global Loading...' : 'Global')}
  </Clerk.Loading>
  
    
      
        {(isLoading) => (isLoading ? 'Loading...' : 'Continue with Google')}
      </Clerk.Loading>
    </Clerk.Connection>
    
      {(isLoading) => (isLoading ? 'Loading...' : 'Submit')}</Clerk.Loading>
    </SignIn.Action>
  </SignIn.Step>
</SignIn.Root>
```

#### Nested loading states

To target the loading state of a specific ``, you need to specify the scope as `provider:<provider name>`.

```tsx
// Filename: page.tsx


  
    {(isGlobalLoading) => (
      
        
          
            {(isLoading) => (isLoading ? 'Loading...' : 'Continue with Google')}
          </Clerk.Loading>
        </Clerk.Connection>
        
          {(isLoading) => (isLoading ? 'Loading...' : 'Submit')}</Clerk.Loading>
        </SignIn.Action>
      </SignIn.Step>
    )}
  </Clerk.Loading>
</SignIn.Root>
```

## ``

Render a link tag that can be used to navigate between `` and `` flows.

- **`navigate`** `sign-in` | `sign-up`

  The destination flow to navigate to.

    ---

- **`children`** `React.ReactNode | ((props: {url: string}) => React.ReactNode)`


### Usage {{ toc: false }}

```tsx
// Filename: page.tsx


  
    Sign up</Clerk.Link>
  </SignIn.Step>
</SignIn.Root>
```

### With render function {{ toc: false }}

```tsx
// Filename: page.tsx


  
    {({ url }) => Sign up}</Clerk.Link>
  </SignIn.Step>
</SignIn.Root>
```
