# UserProfileView


> Clerk's UserProfileView renders a beautiful, full-featured account management UI that allows users to manage their profile and security settings.

The `UserProfileView` renders a comprehensive user profile interface that displays user information and provides account management options. It includes personal information, security settings, account switching, and sign-out functionality.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `UserProfileView` only appears when there is a current user.

## Parameters


  - **`isDismissable`** `Bool`

  Whether the view can be dismissed by the user. When `true`, a dismiss button appears in the navigation bar and the view can be used in sheets or other dismissable contexts. When `false`, no dismiss button is shown, making it suitable for fullscreen usage. Defaults to `true`.


  - **`clerkTheme`** `ClerkTheme`

  The theme to apply to the `UserProfileView`. This will override any theme applied to the `UserProfileView`'s parent view, or configured in the `Clerk` global object.

      ---

- **`onDismiss`** `() -> Unit`

  A callback function that is called when the user dismisses the view, such as when they tap a back button or close button. Use this callback to handle navigation or perform cleanup when the user closes the profile view, for example, navigating back to the previous screen or updating your app's state.


## Usage


  The following examples show how to use the `UserProfileView` in your iOS app.

  ### Dismissible sheet presentation

  Present `UserProfileView` as a dismissible sheet when you want users to be able to close the profile view and return to the previous screen.

  ```swift
  import SwiftUI
  import ClerkKit
  import ClerkKitUI

  struct MainView: View {
    @Environment(Clerk.self) private var clerk
    @State private var profileIsPresented = false

    var body: some View {
      VStack {
        if clerk.user != nil {
          Button("Show Profile") {
            profileIsPresented = true
          }
        }
      }
      .sheet(isPresented: $profileIsPresented) {
        UserProfileView()
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  ### Fullscreen profile view

  Use `UserProfileView` as a fullscreen view when you want to dedicate the entire screen to profile management.

  ```swift
  import SwiftUI
  import ClerkKit
  import ClerkKitUI

  struct ProfileView: View {
    @Environment(Clerk.self) private var clerk

    var body: some View {
      if clerk.user != nil {
        UserProfileView(isDismissable: false)
      }
    }
  }
  ```


  The following example shows how to use the `UserProfileView` in your Android app.

  ### Fullscreen profile view

  Use `UserProfileView` as a fullscreen view when you want to dedicate the entire screen to profile management.

  ```kotlin
  import androidx.compose.runtime.Composable
  import androidx.compose.runtime.getValue
  import androidx.lifecycle.compose.collectAsStateWithLifecycle
  import com.clerk.api.Clerk
  import com.clerk.ui.userprofile.UserProfileView

  @Composable
  fun ProfileView() {
    val user by Clerk.userFlow.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
    if (user != null) {
      UserProfileView()
    }
  }
  ```


## Customization

To learn how to customize Clerk views, see the [dedicated guide](/guides/customizing-clerk/clerk-theme).

If Clerk's prebuilt views don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. For more information, see the [custom flow guides](/guides/development/custom-flows/overview).
