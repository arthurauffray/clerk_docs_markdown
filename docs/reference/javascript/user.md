# User` object


> The User object holds all the information for a user of your application and provides a set of methods to manage their account. Users have a unique authentication identifier which might be their email address, phone number or a username.

The `User` object holds all of the information for a single user of your application and provides a set of methods to manage their account. Each `User` has at least one authentication identifier, which might be their email address, phone number, or a username.

A user can be contacted at their primary email address or primary phone number. They can have more than one registered email address, but only one of them will be their primary email address (`User.primaryEmailAddress`). This goes for phone numbers as well; a user can have more than one, but only one phone number will be their primary (`User.primaryPhoneNumber`). At the same time, a user can also have one or more external accounts by connecting to [social providers](/guides/configure/auth-strategies/social-connections/overview) such as Google, Apple, Facebook, and many more (`User.externalAccounts`).

Finally, a `User` object holds profile data like the user's name, profile picture, and a set of [metadata](/guides/users/extending) that can be used internally to store arbitrary information. The metadata are split into `publicMetadata` and `privateMetadata`. Both types are set from the [Backend API](/reference/backend-api), but public metadata can also be accessed from the [Frontend API](/reference/frontend-api).


The ClerkJS SDK provides some helper [methods](#methods) on the `User` object to help retrieve and update user information and authentication status.

## Methods

### `createBackupCode()`

Generates a fresh new set of backup codes for the user. Every time the method is called, it will replace the previously generated backup codes. Returns a [`BackupCodeResource`][backupcode-ref] object.

```typescript
function createBackupCode(): Promise
```

#### Example

```js
await clerk.user.createBackupCode()
```

### `createEmailAddress()`

Adds an email address for the user. A new [`EmailAddress`][email-ref] will be created and associated with the user.

> [!WARNING]
> [**Email** must be enabled](/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options#email) in your app's settings in the Clerk Dashboard.

```ts
function createEmailAddress(params: CreateEmailAddressParams): Promise
```

#### `CreateEmailAddressParams`

- **`email`** `string`

  The email address to be added to the user.


#### Example

```js
await clerk.user.createEmailAddress({ email: 'test@test.com' })
```

### `createExternalAccount()`

Adds an external account for the user. A new [`ExternalAccount`][exacc-ref] will be created and associated with the user. This method is useful if you want to allow an already signed-in user to connect their account with an external provider, such as Facebook, GitHub, etc., so that they can sign in with that provider in the future.

> [!WARNING]
> The social provider that you want to connect to [must be enabled](/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options#sso-connections) in your app's settings in the Clerk Dashboard.

```ts
function createExternalAccount(params: CreateExternalAccountParams): Promise
```

#### `CreateExternalAccountParams`

- **`strategy`** [`OAuthStrategy`](/reference/javascript/types/sso#o-auth-strategy)

  The strategy corresponding to the OAuth provider. For example: `'oauth_facebook'`, `'oauth_github'`, etc.

    ---

- **`redirectUrl?`** `string`

  The full URL or path that the OAuth provider should redirect to, on successful authorization on their part. Typically, this will be a simple `/sso-callback` route that calls [`Clerk.handleRedirectCallback`](/reference/javascript/clerk#handle-redirect-callback) or mounts the [``](/reference/components/control/authenticate-with-redirect-callback) component. See the [custom flow](/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/oauth-connections) for implementation details.

    ---

- **`additionalScopes?`** `string[]`

  Additional scopes for your user to be prompted to approve.

    ---

- **`oidcPrompt?`** `string`

  The value to pass to the [OIDC `prompt` parameter](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#:~:text=prompt,reauthentication%20and%20consent.) in the generated OAuth redirect URL.

    ---

- **`oidcLoginHint?`** `string`

  The value to pass to the [OIDC `login_hint` parameter](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#:~:text=login_hint,in%20\(if%20necessary\).) in the generated OAuth redirect URL.


#### Example

After calling `createExternalAccount`, the initial `state` of the returned `ExternalAccount` will be `unverified`. To initiate the connection with the external provider, redirect the user to the `externalAccount.verification.externalVerificationRedirectURL` contained in the result of `createExternalAccount`.

Upon return, inspect within the `user.externalAccounts` the entry that corresponds to the requested strategy:

- If the connection succeeded, then `externalAccount.verification.status` will be `verified`.
- If the connection failed, then the `externalAccount.verification.status` will not be `verified` and the `externalAccount.verification.error` will contain the error encountered, which you can present to the user. To learn more about the properties available on `verification`, see the [`VerificationResource`](/reference/javascript/types/verification-resource) reference.

The following example demonstrates how to add a Notion account as an external account for the user. When the user selects the "Add Notion as a social connection" button, the user will be redirected to Notion to connect their account. After connecting their account, they will be redirected to the `/` route of your application, and the status of the connection will be displayed.

### `reload()`

Reloads the user's data from Clerk's API, which is useful when you want to access the latest user data after performing a mutation. To make the updated data immediately available, this method forces a session token refresh instead of waiting for the automatic refresh cycle that could temporarily retain stale information. [Learn more about forcing a token refresh](/guides/sessions/force-token-refresh#user-reload).

You only need to call `user.reload()` if you've updated the `User` object outside of the `user.update()` method or Clerk hooks; for example, if you made changes through an API endpoint.


```ts
function reload(p?: ClerkResourceReloadParams): Promise<this>
```

#### `ClerkResourceReloadParams`

  The publicly accessible url for the image.


#### Example

```js
await clerk.user.setProfileImage({ file: profileImage })
```

### `update()`

Updates the user's attributes. Use this method to save information you collected about the user.

The appropriate settings must be enabled in the Clerk Dashboard for the user to be able to update their attributes. For example, if you want to use the `update({ firstName })` method, you must enable the **First and last name** setting. It can be found on the [**User & authentication**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/user-and-authentication) page in the Clerk Dashboard.

```ts
function update(params: UpdateUserParams): Promise
```

#### `UpdateUserParams`

All props below are optional.

    ---

- **`unsafeMetadata`** [`UserUnsafeMetadata`](/reference/javascript/types/metadata#user-unsafe-metadata)

  Metadata that can be read and set from the Frontend API. One common use case for this attribute is to implement custom fields that will be attached to the `User` object. Updating this value overrides the previous value; it does not merge. To perform a merge, you can pass something like `{ …user.unsafeMetadata, …newData }` to this parameter.


#### Example

```js
await clerk.user.update({ firstName: 'Test' })
```

### `updatePassword()`

Updates the user's password. Passwords must be at least 8 characters long.

```ts
function updatePassword(params: UpdateUserPasswordParams): Promise
```

  newPassword: 'new-password',
})
```

### `verifyTOTP()`

Verifies a TOTP secret after a user has created it. The user must provide a code from their authenticator app that has been generated using the previously created secret. This way, correct set up and ownership of the authenticator app can be validated. Returns a [`TOTPResource`][totp-ref] object.

> [!WARNING]
> The **Authenticator application** multi-factor strategy must be enabled in your app's settings in the Clerk Dashboard. See the [Multi-factor authentication](/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options#multi-factor-authentication) section to learn more.

```typescript
function verifyTOTP(params: VerifyTOTPParams): Promise
```

#### `VerifyTOTPParams`

- **`code`** `string`

  A 6 digit TOTP generated from the user's authenticator app.


#### Example

```js
await clerk.user.verifyTOTP({ code: '123456' })
```
