# create()


> Use Clerk's JS Backend SDK to create an API key.

> [!WARNING]
> API keys is currently in beta. The API may change before general availability.


Creates a new [API key](/guides/development/machine-auth/api-keys). Returns the created [`APIKey`](/reference/backend/types/backend-api-key) object.

```ts
function create(params: CreateAPIKeyParams): Promise
```

## `CreateAPIKeyParams`

- **`name`** `string`

  A descriptive name for the API key (e.g., "Production API Key", "Development Key").

    ---

- **`subject`** `string`

  The user ID (`user_xxx`) or organization ID (`org_xxx`) to associate the API key with.

    ---

- **`description?`** `string | null`

  A longer description of what the API key is used for.

    ---

- **`scopes?`** `string[]`

  An array of scope strings that define what the API key can access.

    ---

- **`claims?`** `Record<string, unknown> | null`

  Additional custom claims to store additional information about the API key.

    ---

- **`createdBy?`** `string | null`

  The user ID of the user creating the API key (for audit purposes).

    ---

- **`secondsUntilExpiration?`** `number | null`

  Number of seconds until the API key expires. Defaults to `null` (API key does not expire).


## Example

> [!NOTE]
> Using `clerkClient` varies based on your framework. Refer to the [JS Backend SDK overview](/js-backend/getting-started/quickstart) for usage details, including guidance on [how to access the `userId` and other properties](/js-backend/getting-started/quickstart#get-the-user-id-and-other-properties).


### Create a basic API key

```tsx
const userId = 'user_123'

const apiKey = await clerkClient.apiKeys.create({
  name: 'My API Key',
  subject: userId,
})
```

### Create an API key with optional parameters

```tsx
const userId = 'user_123'

const apiKey = await clerkClient.apiKeys.create({
  name: 'Production API Key',
  subject: userId,
  description: 'API key for accessing my application',
  scopes: ['read:users', 'write:users'],
  secondsUntilExpiration: 86400, // expires in 24 hours
})
```

> [!WARNING]
> The API key secret is only available in the response from `create()` and cannot be retrieved again. Make sure to store the secret securely immediately after creation.

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `POST/api_keys`. See the [BAPI reference](/reference/backend-api/tag/api-keys/post/api_keys) for more information.
