# getInvitationList()


> Use Clerk's JS Backend SDK to retrieve a list of non-revoked invitations for your application.

Retrieves a list of non-revoked invitations for your application, sorted by descending creation date. Returns a [`PaginatedResourceResponse`](/reference/backend/types/paginated-resource-response) object with a `data` property that contains an array of [`Invitation`](/reference/backend/types/backend-invitation) objects, and a `totalCount` property that indicates the total number of invitations in the system.

```ts
function getInvitationList(
  params: GetInvitationListParams,
): Promise>
```

## `GetInvitationListParams`

- **`status?`** `accepted | pending | revoked`

  Filter by invitation status.

    ---

- **`limit?`** `number`

  The number of results to return. Must be an integer greater than zero and less than 501. Can be used for paginating the results together with `offset`. Defaults to `10`.

    ---

- **`offset?`** `number`

  Skip the first `offset` results when paginating. Needs to be an integer greater or equal to zero. To be used in conjunction with `limit`. Defaults to `0`.


## Examples

### Basic

> [!NOTE]
> Using `clerkClient` varies based on your framework. Refer to the [JS Backend SDK overview](/js-backend/getting-started/quickstart) for usage details, including guidance on [how to access the `userId` and other properties](/js-backend/getting-started/quickstart#get-the-user-id-and-other-properties).


```tsx
const response = await clerkClient.invitations.getInvitationList()
```

### Filter by invitation status

Retrieves list of invitations that have been revoked.

```tsx
// get all revoked invitations
const response = await clerkClient.invitations.getInvitationList({ status: 'revoked' })
```

### Limit the number of results

Retrieves list of invitations that have been revoked that is filtered by the number of results.

```tsx
const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.invitations.getInvitationList({
  status: 'revoked',
  // returns the first 10 results
  limit: 10,
})
```

### Skip results

Retrieves list of invitations that have been revoked that is filtered by the number of results to skip.

```tsx
const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.invitations.getInvitationList({
  status: 'revoked',
  // skips the first 10 results
  offset: 10,
})
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `GET/invitations`. See the [BAPI reference](/reference/backend-api/tag/invitations/get/invitations) for more information.
