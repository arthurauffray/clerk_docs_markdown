# createOrganizationMembership()


> Use Clerk's JS Backend SDK to create a membership to an Organization for a user directly (circumventing the need for an invitation).

Creates a membership to an Organization for a user directly (circumventing the need for an invitation). Returns a [`OrganizationMembership`](/reference/backend/types/backend-organization-membership) object.

```ts
function createOrganizationMembership(
  params: CreateOrganizationMembershipParams,
): Promise
```

## `CreateOrganizationMembershipParams`

- **`organizationId`** `string`

  The ID of the Organization the user is being added to.

    ---

- **`userId`** `string`

  The ID of the user to be added to the Organization.

    ---

- **`role`** `string`

  The [Role](/guides/organizations/control-access/roles-and-permissions) to assign the added user within the Organization.


## Example

> [!NOTE]
> Using `clerkClient` varies based on your framework. Refer to the [JS Backend SDK overview](/js-backend/getting-started/quickstart) for usage details, including guidance on [how to access the `userId` and other properties](/js-backend/getting-started/quickstart#get-the-user-id-and-other-properties).


In the following example, an [`OrganizationMembership`](/reference/backend/types/backend-organization-membership) is created for a user with the Role `org:member`.

```tsx
const organizationId = 'org_123'

const userId = 'user_123'

const role = 'org:member'

const response = await clerkClient.organizations.createOrganizationMembership({
  organizationId,
  userId,
  role,
})
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `POST/organizations/{organization_id}/memberships`. See the [BAPI reference](/reference/backend-api/tag/organization-memberships/post/organizations/\{organization_id}/memberships) for more information.
