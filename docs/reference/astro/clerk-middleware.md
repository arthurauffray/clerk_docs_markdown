# clerkMiddleware()` | Astro


> The clerkMiddleware() function allows you to protect your Astro application using Middleware.

The `clerkMiddleware()` helper integrates Clerk authentication into your Astro application through middleware.

## Configure `clerkMiddleware()`

Create a `middleware.ts` file inside your `src/` directory.

```ts
// Filename: src/middleware.ts

import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/astro/server'

export const onRequest = clerkMiddleware()
```

## `createRouteMatcher()`

`createRouteMatcher()` is a Clerk helper function that allows you to protect multiple routes. `createRouteMatcher()` accepts an array of routes and checks if the route the user is trying to visit matches one of the routes passed to it.

The `createRouteMatcher()` helper returns a function that, if called with the `context.request` object from the Middleware, will return `true` if the user is trying to access a route that matches one of the routes passed to `createRouteMatcher()`.

In the following example, `createRouteMatcher()` sets all `/dashboard` and `/forum` routes as protected routes.

```ts
const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/dashboard(.*)', '/forum(.*)'])
```

## Protect routes

You can protect routes by checking either or both of the following:

- [User authentication status](#protect-routes-based-on-user-authentication-status) -- user is signed in or out
- [User authorization status](#protect-routes-based-on-user-authorization-status) -- user has the required Role or Permission

### Protect routes based on user authentication status

To protect routes based on user authentication status, use [`auth().isAuthenticated`](/reference/backend/types/auth-object) to check if `isAuthenticated` is true. If it's not, the user is not authenticated, and you can redirect them to the sign-in page.

```tsx
// Filename: src/middleware.ts

import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/astro/server'

const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/dashboard(.*)', '/forum(.*)'])

export const onRequest = clerkMiddleware((auth, context) => {
  const { isAuthenticated, redirectToSignIn } = auth()

  if (!isAuthenticated && isProtectedRoute(context.request)) {
    // Add custom logic to run before redirecting

    return redirectToSignIn()
  }
})
```

### Protect routes based on user authorization status

To protect routes based on user authorization status, use [`auth().has()`](/reference/backend/types/auth-object#has) to check if the user has the required Roles or Custom Permissions.

```tsx
// Filename: src/middleware.ts

import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/astro/server'

const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/admin(.*)'])

export const onRequest = clerkMiddleware((auth, context) => {
  const { has, redirectToSignIn } = auth()

  // Restrict admin routes to users with specific Permissions
  if (
    (isProtectedRoute(context.request) && !has({ permission: 'org:admin:example1' })) ||
    !has({ permission: 'org:admin:example2' })
  ) {
    // Add logic to run if the user does not have the required Permissions; for example, redirecting to the sign-in page
    return redirectToSignIn()
  }
})
```

## Protect all routes

To protect all routes in your application and define specific routes as public, you can use any of the above methods and simply invert the `if` condition.

```tsx
import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/astro/server'

const isPublicRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/sign-in(.*)', '/sign-up(.*)'])

export const onRequest = clerkMiddleware((auth, context) => {
  const { isAuthenticated, redirectToSignIn, userId } = auth()

  if (!isPublicRoute(context.request) && !isAuthenticated) {
    return redirectToSignIn()
  }
})
```

## `clerkMiddleware()` options

The `clerkMiddleware()` function accepts an optional object. The following options are available:

- **`audience?`** `string | string[]`

  A string or list of [audiences](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3). If passed, it is checked against the `aud` claim in the token.

    ---

- **`authorizedParties?`** `string[]`

  An allowlist of origins to verify against, to protect your application from the subdomain cookie leaking attack. For example: `['http://localhost:3000', 'https://example.com']`

    ---

- **`clockSkewInMs?`** `number`

  Specifies the allowed time difference (in milliseconds) between the Clerk server (which generates the token) and the clock of the user's application server when validating a token. Defaults to 5000 ms (5 seconds).

    ---

- **`domain?`** `string`

  The domain used for satellites to inform Clerk where this application is deployed.

    ---

- **`isSatellite?`** `boolean`

  When using Clerk's satellite feature, this should be set to `true` for secondary domains.

    ---

- **`satelliteAutoSync?`** `boolean`

  Controls whether a satellite app automatically syncs authentication state with the primary domain on first page load. When `false` (default), the satellite app skips the automatic redirect if no session cookies exist, and only triggers the handshake after the user initiates a sign-in or sign-up action. When `true`, the satellite app redirects to the primary domain on every first visit to sync state. Defaults to `false`. See [satellite domains](/guides/dashboard/dns-domains/satellite-domains) for more details.


    ---

- **`jwtKey`** `string`

  Used to verify the session token in a networkless manner. Supply the **JWKS Public Key** from the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard. **It's recommended to use [the environment variable](/guides/development/clerk-environment-variables) instead.** For more information, refer to [Manual JWT verification](/guides/sessions/manual-jwt-verification).

    ---

- **`organizationSyncOptions?`** <code>[OrganizationSyncOptions](#organization-sync-options) | undefined</code>

  Used to activate a specific [Organization](/guides/organizations/overview) or Personal Account based on URL path parameters. If there's a mismatch between the Active Organization in the session (e.g., as reported by [`auth()`](/reference/nextjs/app-router/auth)) and the Organization indicated by the URL, the middleware will attempt to activate the Organization specified in the URL.

    ---

- **`proxyUrl?`** `string`

  Specify the URL of the proxy, if using a proxy.

    ---

- **`signInUrl`** `string`

  The full URL or path to your sign-in page. Needs to point to your primary application on the client-side. **Required for a satellite application in a development instance.** It's recommended to use [the environment variable](/guides/development/clerk-environment-variables#sign-in-and-sign-up-redirects) instead.

    ---

- **`signUpUrl`** `string`

  The full URL or path to your sign-up page. Needs to point to your primary application on the client-side. **Required for a satellite application in a development instance.** It's recommended to use [the environment variable](/guides/development/clerk-environment-variables#sign-in-and-sign-up-redirects) instead.

    ---

- **`publishableKey`** `string`

  The Clerk Publishable Key for your instance.

    ---

- **`secretKey?`** `string`

  The Clerk Secret Key for your instance. The `CLERK_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable must be set when providing `secretKey` as an option, refer to [Dynamic keys](#dynamic-keys).

    ---

- **`frontendApiProxy?`** [`FrontendApiProxyOptions`](#frontend-api-proxy-options)

  Configure Frontend API proxy handling. When enabled, requests to the proxy path are forwarded to [Clerk's Frontend API](/reference/frontend-api), and the `proxyUrl` is automatically derived for authentication handshake.


### `OrganizationSyncOptions`

The `organizationSyncOptions` property on the [`clerkMiddleware()`](#clerk-middleware-options) options
object has the type `OrganizationSyncOptions`, which has the following properties:

- **`organizationPatterns`** <code>[Pattern](#pattern)\[]</code>

  Specifies URL patterns that are Organization-specific, containing an Organization ID or slug as a path parameter. If a request matches this path, the Organization identifier will be used to set that Organization as active.

    If the route also matches the `personalAccountPatterns` prop, this prop takes precedence.

    Patterns must have a path parameter named either `:id` (to match a Clerk Organization ID) or `:slug` (to match a Clerk Organization slug).

    > [!WARNING]
    > If the Organization can't be activated—either because it doesn't exist or the user lacks access—the previously Active Organization will remain unchanged. Components must detect this case and provide an appropriate error and/or resolution pathway, such as calling `notFound()` or displaying an [``](/reference/components/organization/organization-switcher).

    Common examples:

- **`["/orgs/:slug", "/orgs/:slug/(.*)"]`** `["/orgs/:id", "/orgs/:id/(.*)"]` `["/app/:any/orgs/:slug", "/app/:any/orgs/:slug/(.*)"]`

  ---

- **`personalAccountPatterns`** <code>[Pattern](#pattern)\[]</code>

  URL patterns for resources that exist within the context of a user's Personal Account.

    If the route also matches the `organizationPattern` prop, the `organizationPattern` prop takes precedence.

    Common examples:

- **`["/me", "/me/(.*)"]`** `["/user/:any", "/user/:any/(.*)"]`


### Pattern

A `Pattern` is a `string` that represents the structure of a URL path. In addition to any valid URL, it may include:

- Named path parameters prefixed with a colon (e.g., `:id`, `:slug`, `:any`).
- Wildcard token, `(.*)`, which matches the remainder of the path.

#### Examples

- `/orgs/:slug`

| URL | Matches | `:slug` value |
| - | - | - |
| `/orgs/acmecorp` | ✅ | `acmecorp` |
| `/orgs` | ❌ | n/a |
| `/orgs/acmecorp/settings` | ❌ | n/a |

- `/app/:any/orgs/:id`

| URL | Matches | `:id` value |
| - | - | - |
| `/app/petstore/orgs/org_123` | ✅ | `org_123` |
| `/app/dogstore/v2/orgs/org_123` | ❌ | n/a |

- `/personal-account/(.*)`

| URL | Matches |
| - | - |
| `/personal-account/settings` | ✅ |
| `/personal-account` | ❌ |
